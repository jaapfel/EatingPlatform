# EatingPlatform

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Eating Platformer is a basic Platform game with an eating mechanic that affects the physics 
of the character. If they eat more fattening food they will gain weight making them run slower
and jump not as high. In contrast, if they eat healthy food they will loose weight allowing them
to run faster and jump higher. Like with any platformer there are obstacles for the player to
defeat; some examples of this are ice and quicksand. As expected, the heavier the player is the 
faster they sink in the quicksand or they have no hope with the ice. There are also objects in the
world for the player to interact with like spring boards to allow them to jump even higher.
